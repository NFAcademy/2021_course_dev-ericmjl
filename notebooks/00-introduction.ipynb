    "and videos to show you answers to the questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is gradient-based optimization?\n",
    "2. How do we optimize parameter values to fit data in linear models?\n",
    "3. How do the concepts from linear models transfer over to logistic models?\n",
    "3. How does that same knowledge transfer conceptually to neural network models?\n",
